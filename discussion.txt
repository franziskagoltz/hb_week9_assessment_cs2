Recursion:

1. Recursion is when a function calls itself solve the problem the function is 
   supposed to solve one or more times. 

2. It is neccessary to have a base case, otherwise the function will call itself
   continuously resulting in a traceback error, telling us the maxiumum recursion 
   depth is exceeded.


Graphs:

1. A graph is an abstract data type that is used to record / show relationships between
   things. 

2. A graph is different from a tree, because nodes in a graph can loop around and
   reference themselves or ealier nodes. A node can also have multiple parents in a graph, which
   is something that is not allowed in a tree. 
   A graph can be directed or undirected. If it is undirected, we can reference 
   the earlier nodes as well. A tree is often used to show hierarchy, whereas a graph
   doesn't have heirarchy, but us more often used to show relationships.

3. A social network or walking/driving path recommendations to get from point A to point B
